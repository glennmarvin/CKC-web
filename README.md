# CKC-web
Web app for an international manufacturer of eco-friendly products.

##  Background
I built this website for a manufacturer of eco-friendly consumer products. I was the sole developer and had the freedom to use the technology I wanted given that:
- the company could update their product catalogue,
- could style certain elements of the website,
- and users could select their preferred language (Traditional Chinese or English);

## Tech
I used Python Django as a web framework because:
- it is very easy to work with and has low development time,
- it comes with an out-of-the-box admin portal which I the company could use to adjust their styling and update their product catalogue,
- and integrates with many other useful python libraries.

The language of the website is automatically detected (based on the browser language). If the user would like a different language, they could select a different language which will then be stored in local storage and used for a next visit.
